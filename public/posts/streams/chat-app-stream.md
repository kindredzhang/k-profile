# Live Coding: Building a Real-time Chat App

Join me in this live coding session where we build a complete real-time chat application using modern web technologies.

## What We Built

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Socket.io
- **Real-time Features**: Live messaging and user presence
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design

## Technologies Used

- React 18 with hooks
- Socket.io for WebSocket connections
- Express.js for the server
- MongoDB for message persistence

The stream lasted 3 hours and covered everything from project setup to deployment, with live Q&A throughout the session.
